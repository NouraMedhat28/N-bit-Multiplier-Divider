# N-bit-Multiplier-Divider
### The repository has the implementation of a N-bit multiplier/divider. We have built 4 modules, sequential multiplier, sequential divider, combination multiplier, and combinational divider.

## - Sequential Multiplier
### - Booth's Algorithm
#### In order to build a sequential multiplier, Booth's algorithm was chosen for this task. Booth's algorithm has its own decoding table, which is as follows:
